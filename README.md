# Send Me to Space AR Effect

AR effect for Creative Technology Week 2021. For this effect, we crowd sourced ideas from our Instagram followers.<br /> 


The brief was broad. We invited big-thinking and received tons of incredible ideas; from a virtual tarot deck, to an effect that would select which snack to munch whilst attending the festival. <br />


We put a short-list of top ideas to a public vote and the winner was “Send me to space!” which just so happened to match our galaxy-vibe of the festival graphics!
